# PressConFX

Note: This is currently a work in progress. It should be ready by
the time the Private Schools Press Conference cycle for this School Year
begins.

Update: Well, because I was very busy these past few months and because the Private Schools Press Conference
was moved forward to accomodate the schedule of the DepEd, this project did not make
it to the opening of the 2016 PSPC.

This project, however, will not be abandoned. Development on it might slow down
but I do hope to finish this system in time for next year's. Stay tuned.

WHAT IS THIS?
------------

PressConFX is a rewrite of the Private Schools Press Conference Management Software (PSPCMS).

The current software suite we are using is a mix of Python, C, and Tcl/Tk programs that was first written more than ten years ago. It was designed to run on Linux. This project aims to port the PSPC Software to JavaFX. Hopefully, this port to Java8 should allow the software to run on Windows and Macs.

Please read the file NOTES for the progress reports.
