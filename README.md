# PressConFX

WHAT IS THIS?
------------

PressConFX is a rewrite of the Private Schools Press Conference Management Software (PSPCMS) into JavaFX.

The current software suite we are using is a mix of Python, C, and Tcl/Tk programs that was first written more than ten years ago. It was designed to run on Linux. This project aims to port the PSPC Software to JavaFX in order to allow the software to run on Windows and Macs.

Work on this software has slowed down because the source code is currently being refactored to make
the design compatible with Android. This program is intended to be portable to Android via the JavaFX Ports
project.

Please read the file NOTES for more progress reports.
