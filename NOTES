PROGRESS NOTES.

4 Sept 2016
----------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Refactored the branches of this repository. Branch gradle merged
    with master. Branch master now contains
    the latest changes while branch gradle is due for deletion.
    Do not use branch gradle anymore.

--- Attempted to refactor the source code so it appears like an Android
    application. ie, choosing a menu item should make the new Activity
    overwrite the window of the calling window. Didn't quite work.

    However, it turns out that Android design guidelines specifically
    advises that an application be divided into cooperating activities.
    That means the old style used for PressConFX is the recommended 
    style. ie: Each selection of a menu item should call up an independent
    activity re Android Guidelines.

    Hence: For this application, selecting a menu item should call up
    a different Stage. I have resorted to calling the Stages as Activities
    in order to reflect the Android paradigm.

--- Work on using the gradle build language for this project started.
    A new branch called 'gradle' was opened and this branch will receive
    all of the new updates. Branch master is currently frozen.
